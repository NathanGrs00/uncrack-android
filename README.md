# üîè Featues 

- **Secure Vault for Passwords:** UnCrack allows users to securely store and manage their passwords, with access protected by encryption and possibly biometric authentication (fingerprint/face recognition).

- **Data Encryption:** All sensitive data, such as passwords and notes, are encrypted using industry-standard encryption methods (like AES-256) to prevent unauthorized access.

- **Password Generator:** The app includes a built-in password generator to help users create strong, unique passwords for improved security.

- **Password Health Checker:** A built-in password health checker that can help you identify which passwords are weak and strong and you can change them according to it.

- **Auto-Lock Mechanism:** The app automatically locks after a certain period of inactivity, requiring the user to re-authenticate.
